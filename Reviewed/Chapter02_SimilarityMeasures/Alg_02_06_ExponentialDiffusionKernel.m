% Description: Computes the exponential diffusion kernel and the
%              Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel matrix of a
%              connected weighted undirected graph.
%
% INPUT:
% -------
% - A : the (n x n) weighted adjacency matrix of a undirected, connected
%       graph G.
% - alpha : the discounting parameter, stricly higher than 0.
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------
% - output : a structure containing :
%           output.K_ED  - the (n x n) exponential diffusion kernel matrix, based
%                   on matrix exponential.
%           output.K_LED - the (n x n) Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel
%                   matrix.

%% Checks of arguments

% Check if squared matrix
[n, m] = size(A);
if n ~= m
    error('The adjacency matrix is not squared.')
end

% Check if symmetric matrix / graph is undirected
if ~isequal(A, A')
    error('The adjacency matrix is not symmetric.')
end

% Check if alpha has a correct value
if alpha <= 0
    error('The discounting factor is outside the valid range (should be > 0)')
end

%% Algorithm

% Degree Matrix
Diag_d = diag( A*ones(n,1) );

% Laplacian Matrix
L = Diag_d - A;

% Exponential diffusion kernel matrix
output.K_ED = expm( alpha*A );

% Laplacian Exponential diffusion kernel matrix
output.K_LED = expm( -alpha*L );

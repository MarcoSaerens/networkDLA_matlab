% Description: Computes the Blondel and al. similarity matrix
%              between nodes of two weighted, directed graphs
%
% INPUT:
% -------
% - A : the (n_A x n_A) weighted adjacency matrix of a directed graph G_A.
% - B : the (n_B x n_B) weighted adjacency matrix of a directed graph G_B.
% - (optional) threshold : the convergence threshold (default = 1e-3).
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------
% - K : The n_B x n_A similarity matrix between nodes of graphs G_B
%       and G_A.

%% Checks of arguments

% Default convergence threshold

end

% Check if A is a squared matrix
[n_A, m_A] = size(A);
if n_A ~= m_A
    error('The adjacency matrix A is not squared.')
end

% Check if B is a squared matrix
[n_B, m_B] = size(B);
if n_B ~= m_B
    error('The adjacency matrix B is not squared.')
end

%% Algorithm

% Initialistion K = E
K = ones(n_B, n_A);

% Iterations
convergence = 0;
i = 0;
while ~convergence
    
    K_old = K;
    
    % Matrix of iterated scores containing similarities between nodes
    K = (B*K*A') + (B'*K*A);
    
    % Normalize the matrix by its Frobenius Norm
    K = K / norm(K,'fro');
    
    i = i + 1;
    if (~mod(i,2)) && (max( max( abs(K - K_old) ) ) < threshold) % convergence condition
        convergence = 1;
    end
end

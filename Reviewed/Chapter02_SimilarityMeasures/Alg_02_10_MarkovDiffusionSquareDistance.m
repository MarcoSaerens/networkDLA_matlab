% Description: Computes the Markov diffusion square distance and kernel
%              matrix of a weighted directed graph.
%
% INPUT:
% -------
% - A : the (n x n) weighted adjacency matrix of a directed graph G.
% - w : the weighting factors w_k >= 0 associated with each node k in
%       vector w. When the Markov chain is regular, the usual weighting
%       factor is w_k = 1/pi_k where pi_k is entry k of the stationary
%       distribution.
% - t : the considered number of steps (or transitions) of the Markov
%       process.
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------
% - output : a structure containing :
%           output.D_MD  - the (n x n) Markov diffusion squared distances
%                      matrix, original version.
%           output.D_MDA - the (n x n) Markov diffusion squared distances
%                      matrix, time-averaged version.
%           output.K_MD  - the (n x n) Markov diffusion kernel matrix,
%                      original version.
%           output.K_MDA - the (n x n) Markov diffusion kernel matrix,
%                      time-averaged version.

%% Checks of arguments

% Check if squared matrix

if n ~= m
    error('The adjacency matrix is not squared')
end

% Check if length of w is correct
if length(w) ~= n
    error('The weigthing vector has not the correct dimension')
end

% Check if the weighting factors have correct values
if min(w) < 0
    error('The weighting vector has at least a negative value')
end

% Check if t is >= 1
if t < 1
    error('The number of step should be >= 1')

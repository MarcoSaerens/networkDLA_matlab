% Description: Computes the shortest path directed distances between all
%              pairs of nodes by Floyd-Warshall algorithm, in matrix form.
%
% INPUT:
% -------
% - C : the (n x n) nonnegative cost matrix, representing
%       a directed weighted graph. C(i,j) == Inf <=> A(i,j) == 0.
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------
% - D : the (n x n) directed shortest path distance matrix between every
%        pair of nodes.

%% Checks of arguments

% Check if squared matrix
[n, m] = size(C);
if n ~= m
    error('The adjacency matrix is not squared.')
end

%% Algorithm

% Column vector full of 1s
e = ones(n,1);

% Initialize distances to costs
D = C;

% Set diagonal to zero
D(1:n+1:end) = 0;

% Iterations
for t = 1:n % enumerate intermediate nodes
    D = min( D, (D(:, t)*(e') + e*D(t, :)) ); % recompute distances 
end

end
